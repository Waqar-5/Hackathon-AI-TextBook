# Quickstart for Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module focuses on educational content and simulation examples. There are no API contracts or external services to integrate directly as part of this module's implementation.

**To get started with Module 2:**

1.  **Review the Specification**: Familiarize yourself with `specs/001-digital-twin-module-2/spec.md`.
2.  **Explore Documentation Structure**: Understand how the new chapters will fit into the Docusaurus structure (`docusaurus/docusaurus/docs/module2/`).
3.  **Examine Example Code**: Review the planned structure for simulation examples in `examples/module2/`.
4.  **Set up Development Environment**: Ensure your development environment is configured with:
    *   Python 3.10
    *   ROS 2 Humble
    *   Gazebo
    *   Unity
    *   Docusaurus development environment (for building the documentation site)

Further details on specific examples and tasks will be provided within the individual chapter documentation.
