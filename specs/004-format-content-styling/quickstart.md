# Quickstart for Format Content Styling

This feature focuses on professional formatting of existing content. It does not involve API contracts or external services.

**To get started with this formatting task:**

1.  **Review the Specification**: Familiarize yourself with `specs/004-format-content-styling/spec.md` to understand the scope and constraints of the formatting.
2.  **Understand the Target Content**: The formatting applies to all Docusaurus markdown files within `docusaurus/docusaurus/docs/`.
3.  **Docusaurus Environment**: Ensure your Docusaurus development environment is set up and runnable locally to preview changes (`npm install` and `npm run start` in `docusaurus/docusaurus`).
4.  **Style Guide**: If a specific style guide exists beyond the general markdown best practices, it should be consulted. This feature primarily applies general professional formatting and Docusaurus markdown conventions.

**Important Considerations**:

*   The core constraint is to preserve the exact meaning, wording, and technical accuracy of the original content.
*   Focus on improving styling, spacing, headings, bold/italic usage, lists, and layout for enhanced readability.
*   Validate changes by conducting Docusaurus builds to ensure no rendering errors are introduced.
