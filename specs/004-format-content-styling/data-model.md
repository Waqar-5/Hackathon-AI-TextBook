# Data Model for Format Content Styling

This feature operates directly on textual content (markdown source files) and does not involve specific data entities or models in a traditional software development sense.

## Conceptual Entity: Markdown Source File Content

-   **Description**: The raw text content of the Docusaurus markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`) located within the `docusaurus/docusaurus/docs/` directory.
-   **Key Aspects**:
    -   Contains technical explanations, code snippets, lists, headings, etc.
    -   Its meaning, wording, and technical accuracy MUST be preserved.
    -   Target for formatting improvements (styling, spacing, headings, bold/italic usage, lists, layout).

## No Traditional Data Model

This `data-model.md` describes the primary operational target for this feature. It does not define a database schema or API data structures.
