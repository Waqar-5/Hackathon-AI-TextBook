# Quickstart for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module focuses on advanced conceptual explanations and integration patterns for building Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems in robotics. There are no API contracts or external services to integrate directly as part of this module's documentation content, as it describes a conceptual framework.

**To get started with Module 4:**

1.  **Review the Specification**: Familiarize yourself with `specs/003-vla-robot-brain/spec.md`.
2.  **Explore Documentation Structure**: Understand how the new chapters will fit into the Docusaurus structure (`docusaurus/docusaurus/docs/module4/`).
3.  **Understand Key Technologies**:
    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Basic understanding of how LLMs work and their capabilities in natural language understanding and generation.
    *   **OpenAI Whisper**: Familiarity with automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.
    *   **ROS 2**: Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts, especially actions and commands for robot control.
4.  **Reference Materials**: The module will cite authoritative sources (ROS 2 documentation, OpenAI Whisper documentation, robotics papers) which should be reviewed for deeper understanding.

This module aims to provide a high-level understanding of VLA system integration; hands-on setup of these complex ecosystems is outside the scope of this quickstart, but the module will guide the reader on what components are involved.
