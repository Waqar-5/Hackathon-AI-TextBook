## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the task list for "Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System".

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, actionable task list for implementing Module 1, organized by user stories and phases, which will guide the development process.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files:
  - `specs/001-module1-ros2-basics/tasks.md` (Created)
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next logical step would be to start implementing the tasks using `/sp.implement`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process successfully translated the plan and spec into granular, executable steps, incorporating the project's constitutional principles.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
